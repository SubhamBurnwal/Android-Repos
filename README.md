# Android Repos
 Some Android Apps that began as hobby projects, and some backups.

Folders:

AsianTales: choose-your-own-story game based on Indian folk tales

Backups: backups of all resources and older working versions of projects (made when repo was not uploaded to git.) Set to ignored as of 03-04-2022.

Kudoku: Sudoku variant puzzle which replaces Sudoku's cell hints with sum-of-region hints

DungeonDash: Sidescrolling puzzle platformer from scratch
